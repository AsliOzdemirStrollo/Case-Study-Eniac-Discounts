# Case-Study-Eniac-Discounts
We will keep working for Eniac —the e-commerce tech company— as a Data Analyst. This time you will work with internal data, which is not anonymised… but a bit more chaotic! The complexity of these tasks will require you to use Python, rather than SQL.

The company has high hopes put into the possibilities that come with Data Analysis, and they are especially hopeful that your work can finally settle an ongoing debate: whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products.

The Marketing Team Lead is convinced that offering discounts is beneficial in the long run. She believes discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.
The main investors in the Board are worried about offering aggressive discounts. They have pointed out how the company’s recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in the total revenue. They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment, rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
